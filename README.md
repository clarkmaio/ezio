# ezio (just an altair wrapper)

The idea behind this package is quite simple: create a wrapper of [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) similar to what [plotly-express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) did for plotly.

My hope is to remove friction while creating simple plots. Big focus on interaction between subplots that I think is the killing feature of `altair`.

The motto of this packae is modularity. No fuctions with 1 billion parameters (I'm looking at you plotly) but rather multiple methods to concatenate at will.
